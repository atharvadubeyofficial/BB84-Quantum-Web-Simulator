# 🔒 BB84 Quantum Key Distribution – Phase 2 (Flask Web Version) 

This repository marks Phase 2 of India's Quantum Cybersecurity Shield simulation project – transitioning from a standalone GUI application to a web-based simulation using Flask and HTML templates.

## 🧠 What's New in Phase 2?
- 🖥️ *Localhost Web App* built with Flask
- ✅ Full BB84 protocol logic preserved from Phase 1
- 🎯 **Auto-detection of eavesdropping** (based on error rate > 20%)
- 🔑 Real-time key generation and encryption-decryption
- 📊 Display of photon mismatches when Eve is present
- 🌐 Interface simulates communication channel between sender & receiver
- Secure channel generation and real world noise factor included.

## 🌍 National Use-Case Vision
This version demonstrates how BB84 quantum key exchange protocols can be **scaled to real-world web environments**, laying the groundwork for **secure communication channels between satellites and Earth stations**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python ( no external quantum libraries just pure python)
- Flask
- HTML, CSS
- Matplotlib (in Phase 1 for plotting)

## 🛰️ Built With National Cybersecurity in Mind
This simulation is being continuously developed as a potential model for govt. organizations and other defense R&D bodies focusing on **quantum-safe communication**.
